# Digital-Signal-Processing-Project_Public
Digital Image Processing refers to the manipulation of image data which is motivated by conversion
between Special and Frequency domains. Image classification, or object recognition, is the process of
identifying a specific object or class of objects in an image or video. Computer Vision System Toolbox™
offers a variety of algorithms, tools, and techniques to create image classification and object recognition
systems. This project shows how to use a “bag of features” approach for image category classification.
This technique is also often referred to as bag of words. Visual image categorization is a process of
assigning a category label to an image under test. Categories may contain images representing just about
anything, for example, dogs, cats, trains, or boats. Here we have tried to show Image Blurring, edge
detection, line detection, sharpening an image, image histogram, compressing an image, fast-Fourier
transform on images, low-Pass filter on images, high pass filter on images. This are some application
areas of DSP on image category but we tried to relate the concepts that we have learned in class to real
time applications. Through this project imread() and imshow() functions are used to load and display an
images respectively.
